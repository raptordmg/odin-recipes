    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This recipe makes light and fluffy pancakes that are great for a snack.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>135g of plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tea spoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tea spoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 table spoons of caster sugar</li>
        <li>130ml of milk</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 table spoons of melted butter or olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl. In a separate bowl or jug, lightly
            whisk together the milk and egg, then whisk in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter. Any
            lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When it's melted, add a ladle of
            batter (or two if your frying pan is big enough to cook two pancakes at the same time). It will seem very
            thick but this is how it should be. Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, then turn it over
            and cook until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm/Â½in thick.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all the batter is used up. You can keep the pancakes warm in a low oven, but they taste best
            fresh out the pan.</li>
    </ol>
