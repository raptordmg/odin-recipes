    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a simple cookie recipe that only uses 5 ingredients and can be prepared in 5 minutes and then takes 12
        minutes to cook although it's recommended to leave the cookie dough for an hour before cooking to help the
        cookies hold their shape. You can use chocolate chips or raisins to make you cookies and you can decide between
        light brown sugar to make softer cookies or caster sugar to make crispier cookies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g of lightly salted butter</li>
        <li>125g of soft light brown or golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>175g of self raising flour</li>
        <li>100g chocolate chips or raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3 and line two baking trays with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Using a stand mixer on medium speed, cream the butter and sugar together for about 3 minutes until soft and
            pale. Add the egg and mix for a further minute. Add the flour and mix with a rubber spatula until just
            combined, then beat thoroughly. Stir in the chocolate chips or raisins.</li>
        <li>If you have time, cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour before baking. Roll the dough into walnut-sized
            balls and arrange on the trays, leaving space between them as they will spread during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 12 minutes, or until the cookies are firm and golden brown at the edges. Leave to cool on the
            baking trays; the cookies will firm further as they cool.</li>
    </ol>
