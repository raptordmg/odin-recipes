    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a simple cookie recipe that only uses 5 ingredients and can be prepared in 5 minutes and then takes 12
        minutes to cook although it's recommended to leave the cookie dough for an hour before cooking to help the
        cookies hold their shape. You can use chocolate chips or raisins to make you cookies and you can decide between
        light brown sugar to make softer cookies or caster sugar to make crispier cookies.</p>
